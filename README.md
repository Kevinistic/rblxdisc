### connecting your roblox client status to a discord bot

## Guide
1. press the green '<> Code'
2. click 'Download ZIP'
3. extract to a file
4. create a new file called ".env" in the same folder (.env, not env! make sure the dot is there)!
5. open the .env file on notepad
6. insert and save:
```bash
DISCORD_TOKEN=<your discord bot token here>
USER_ID=<your discord account user id here>
```
7. open terminal in the same file
### For Linux (SKIP IF YOU USE WINDOWS)
7. 1. just run the code below:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv git -y
sudo apt install scrot python3-tk python3-dev -y
```
7. 2. when done, continue to step 5

8. run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
9. run this every time you want to start the whole thing (after pc restart, etc)
```bash
python wrapper.py # RUN ONLY THIS IF WINDOWS
python3 wrapper.py # RUN ONLY THIS IF LINUX
```

## Credits
- @cn3z on Discord: everything lol

## Future Ideas
- honestly, program is considered complete.
- maybe i will fix this if roblox/discord changes somethings which may break the bot
   
## Contribution
this is currently a solo project, and it'll stay that way for a long time. unless, you can convince me otherwise or you have a MAJOR improvement. let me know in Discord (@cn3z). you can fork it if u want
